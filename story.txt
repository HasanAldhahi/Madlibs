Hi you know my name, I am Louis[n], I am writing to you, the super hero inside me. I want to know why are you always Sad[a]. You already can speak Japanese[n] fluently. You can play guitar[n]. You also can code[v] JAVA[n] without asking help from Halit[n]. You are Luffy[n] without his hands. Do not underestimate[v] yourself. You can be a shining[a] star[n] with a little supernova. Get out and shine out there.
